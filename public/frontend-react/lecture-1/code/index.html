    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Web development is evolving faster than ever. From AI-powered tools to new frameworks,
    the landscape in 2026 looks dramatically different from just a few years ago. In this article,
    we'll explore the key trends every developer should know.</p>

    <h2>Top Technologies to Learn</h2>
    <p>If you're starting your web development journey, focus on these core technologies:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>HTML &amp; CSS</strong> — The foundation of every website</li>
        <li><strong>JavaScript</strong> — The programming language of the web</li>
        <li><strong>React</strong> — The most popular UI library</li>
        <li><strong>Next.js</strong> — Full-stack React framework</li>
        <li><strong>TypeScript</strong> — Type-safe JavaScript for large projects</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Why HTML Still Matters</h2>
    <p>Despite the rise of complex frameworks, HTML remains the backbone of the web.
    Every React component, every Next.js page ultimately renders as HTML in the browser.</p>
    <p>Understanding HTML deeply gives you:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Better accessibility for all users</li>
        <li>Improved SEO for search engines</li>
        <li>Faster debugging skills</li>
        <li>A solid foundation for learning CSS and JavaScript</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>The Role of Semantic HTML</h3>
    <p>In our next lecture, we'll dive into <strong>semantic HTML</strong> — using elements
    that describe their meaning, not just their appearance. This is what separates
    professional developers from beginners.</p>

    <h2>Getting Started</h2>
    <p>The best way to learn web development is by building projects. Here's what you need:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>A text editor — we recommend <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com" target="_blank">VS Code</a></li>
        <li>A modern browser — <a href="https://www.google.com/chrome" target="_blank">Google Chrome</a> with DevTools</li>
        <li>Curiosity and consistency</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>The web is the most accessible platform in the world. With just a text editor and
    a browser, you can create something that billions of people can access. That's the
    power of what you're learning today.</p>
